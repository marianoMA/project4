<div style="float:center"><p style="text-align: center;">You're probably thinking why would you join and risk your life? Well let me tell you,</center></p>
<p> 1. Protect the land you love from being conquered.</p>
<p> 2. Protect your family and loved ones from being hurt or being killed</p>
<p> 3. Don't look like a coward but a hero.</p>
<p> 4. One day when we win the war, your daughter will ask "Daddy what did you do during the war?" and you could proudly tell her that you fought like the man you are!</p>
<p> Join the rebellion now and help us protect the land we love!!!!</p>
